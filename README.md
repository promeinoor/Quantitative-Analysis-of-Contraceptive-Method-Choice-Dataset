The problem is predicting a woman's current contraceptive method choice (no use, long-term, or short-term) based on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The original creator is Tjen-Sien Lim (limt '@' stat.wisc.edu). The dataset is available at **[this link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice))**
